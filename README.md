#Products API

API for CRUD operations on products and a JWT authentication & authorization system for users that act as merchants, with products belonging to their imaginary shops.

The API can be tested by hitting the **/api** route.

###Inside the Swagger UI page
In order to make authorized requests, first hit the register/login route with credentials in order to be issued a temporary access token. Then, press the green 'Authorize' button below to save your token and gain access to all protected routes.
